The base preset is hidden: true — it's only for inheritance, never used directly.
CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS generates compile_commands.json which clang-tidy and IDEs need for accurate analysis.
Build/test presets (buildPresets, testPresets) require preset version 4+ (CMake 3.23+).
With our CMake 3.22 we use version 3, which only supports configurePresets.
Build and test commands are slightly more explicit without those presets:
  cmake --preset debug          (configure)
  cmake --build build/debug     (build)
  ctest --test-dir build/debug  (test)
